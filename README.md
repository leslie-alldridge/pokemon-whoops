# Task requirements

- Users are seeing the loading text display but nothing ever loads, investigate this behaviour
- A new feature to view a picture of the pokemon is requested often
- When doing two back to back searches it's frustrating having to clear the input box manually
- Error messages are alert pop ups which users don't like clicking, can they display on the page as text?

You are welcome to submit quality of life fixes or styling enhancements but we really need the first four items shipped before August (Pokemon-go launch date).

# Tips

- Talk through what you think the code is doing at a high level
- Comment or note down relationships between script.js and index.html
- When thinking of solutions ignore code or implementation, focus on how it should behave first
- If requirements are unclear we can proceed with assumptions or ask for clarification
- Effective searching, instead of googling `XMLHttpRequest jquery` try to be a bit more specific `parse XMLHttpRequest to json jquery`
- Quality of life fixes are good if you have confidence, otherwise they can lead to large delays and high stress
